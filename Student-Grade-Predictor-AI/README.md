# Student-Grade-Predictor-AI
This is my first AI project. It can be used to predict grades based on various variables with artificial intelligence. Variables include previous grades, absences, and study time. The data set used for training the AI was provided by the University of California Irvine. The program was trained using 649 instances with an accuracy of about 95.6%.
